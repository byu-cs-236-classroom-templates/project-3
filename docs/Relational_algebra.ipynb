    "## 1. What is a Relation\n",
    "\n",
    "The textbook defines as relation as a set of mathematical tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $R\\subset A\\times B$\n",
    "* $R=\\{(a,1),(b,2),(c,3),(d,4)\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In relational databases, the same relation is represented as a table (with a header) instead of as a set:\n",
    "\n",
    "| `char` | `int` | \n",
    "| :-: | :-: | \n",
    "| $a$ | $1$ |\n",
    "| $b$ | $2$ | \n",
    "| $c$ | $3$ | \n",
    "| $d$ | $4$ | \n",
    "\n",
    "The table __header__ contains the **attributes** associated with each element of the tuple. You can think of the attributes specified in the header as assigning names to each column. For example, the first column in the relation above contains elements from the set `char` and the second column contains elements from the set `int`. The header contains information about the sets from which the cartesian product is formed, $R\\subseteq $`char`$ \\times$ `int`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below the header are rows containing __tuples__. The tuples are the elements of the __set__ that defines the relation, $R=\\{(a,1),(b,2),(c,3),(d,4)\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of elements in a set doesn't matter\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\{(a,1),(b,2),(c,3),(d,4)\\} = \\{(d,4),(b,2),(a,1),(c,3)\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the order of the rows in the table doesn't matter (except for the header) because the rows represent the set of tuples. For example, the following table represents the same relation as the table above.\n",
    "\n",
    "| `char` | `int` | \n",
    "| :-: | :-: | \n",

    "## 2. Encoding a Relation as a Python Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's construct a class that represents a relation.  The class members need to encode the parts of the table. Thus, there needs to be a class member for the header and another class member for the set of tuples. To help with the discussion, we'll also include the name of the relation in the code below, but you won't see this in the starter code for Project 3. Thus, the relation class will include:\n",
    "- The relation name as a `str`. \n",
    "- The relation header will be defined as a list of strings: `list[str]`\n",
    "- Each tuple in the relation will be defined as a new type called `RelationTuple`\n",
    "  - The `RelationTuple` will be built using Python's default `tuple` type.  \n",
    "  - The class created below allows both integers and strings to be the elements of a tuple, so look for the vertical bar that says the tuple types can be either an int or a str yielding `RelationTuple = tuple[str | int]`\n",
    "  - We won't specify how many elements will be in the `RelationTuple` so we'll use Python's `...` to indicate that we can have several tuples yielding `RelationTuple = tuple[str | int, ...]`\n",
    "- A helper `__str__` method that returns a string in the correct format. This method will use a table formatting tool in Python called `tabulate`, which should have been installed when you executed `pip install --editable \".[dev]\"`."
